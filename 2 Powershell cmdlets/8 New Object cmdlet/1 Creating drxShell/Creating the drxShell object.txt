Creating the drxShell object

To create a new instance of the derxShell object, use the New-Object cmdlet while specifying the
-ComObject parameter and supplying the program ID of wscript.shell. Hold the object created in a
variable. Here’s an example.

   $drxShell = New-Object -comobject "wscript.shell"

After the object has been created and stored in a variable, you can directly use any of the methods
that are provided by the object. This is shown in the two lines of code that follow.

   $drxShell = New-Object -comobject "wscript.shell"
   $drxShell.run("calc.exe")
