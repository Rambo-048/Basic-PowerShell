Creating a sorted process list

1. Enter the following command into the Windows PowerShell console.
   Get-Process
2. Send the output of the Get-Process cmdlet to the Get-Member cmdlet.
   Get-Process | Get-Member
3. Examine the property section. Note that CPU is a script property.
4. Pipeline the results from the Get-Process cmdlet to the Sort-Object cmdlet and use the
   cpu property.
   Get-Process | Sort-Object cpu
5. Retrieve the previous command and add the -Descending switch parameter.
   Get-Process | Sort-Object cpu -Descending
6. Send the whole thing to the Out-GridView cmdlet. The command appears here.
   Get-Process | Sort-Object cpu -Descending | Out-GridView
