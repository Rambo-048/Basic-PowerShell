Get Verb

There are 98 approved verbs in Windows PowerShell 5.0. This number increases the 96 approved
verbs from Windows PowerShell 2.0 by only two new verbs. The two additional verbs are use and
unprotect and were introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0. This means that the number of approved
verbs has remained stable for three versions now. This is shown in the command that follows, where
the Measure-Object cmdlet returns the count of the different verbs.
