Creating a personal Windows PowerShell profile

1. In a Windows PowerShell console, check your script execution policy.
     Get-ExecutionPolicy
2. If the script execution policy is restricted, change it to remotesigned, but only for the current user.
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope currentuser -ExecutionPolicy remotesigned
3. Review the description about Windows PowerShell execution policies, and enter Y to agree to
   make the change.
4. In a Windows PowerShell prompt, determine whether a profile exists by using the following
   command. (By default, the Windows PowerShell profile does not exist.)
     Test-Path $profile
5. If Test-Path returns false, create a new profile file by using the following command.
     New-Item -path $profile -itemtype file -force
6. Open the profile file in the Windows PowerShell ISE by using the following command.
     ise $profile
7. Create an alias in the profile named gh that resolves to the Get-Help cmdlet. This command
   appears here.
     Set-Alias gh Get-Help
8. Create a function that edits your Windows PowerShell console profile. This function appears
   here.
     Function Set-Profile
     {
       Ise $profile
     }
9. Start the Windows PowerShell Transcript command via the Windows PowerShell profile. To do
   this, add the Start-Transcript cmdlet as it appears here. (The Start-Transcript cmdlet creates a
   record of all Windows PowerShell commands, and the output from those commands.)
     Start-Transcript
10. Save the modifications to the Windows PowerShell console profile by clicking the Save icon on
    the toolbar, or by choosing Save from the File menu.
11. Close the Windows PowerShell ISE and close the Windows PowerShell console.
12. Open the Windows PowerShell console. You should now get the output in the console from
    starting the Windows PowerShell transcript utility
