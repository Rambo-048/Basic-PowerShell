SET EXECUTION POLICY

6 Option Set Execution Policy :
- Restricted Does not load configuration files such as the Windows PowerShell profile or run
other scripts. Restricted is the default.
- AllSigned Requires that all scripts and configuration files be signed by a trusted publisher,
including scripts that you write on the local computer.
- RemoteSigned Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the Internet
be signed by a trusted publisher.
- Unrestricted Loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If you run an unsigned script
that was downloaded from the Internet, you are prompted for permission before it runs.
- Bypass Blocks nothing and issues no warnings or prompts.
- Undefined Removes the currently assigned execution policy from the current scope. This
parameter will not remove an execution policy that is set in a Group Policy scope.


3 Different Scope :
- Process The execution policy affects only the current Windows PowerShell process.
- CurrentUser The execution policy affects only the current user.
- LocalMachine The execution policy affects all users of the computer. Setting the LocalMachine
execution policy requires administrator rights on the local computer. By default,
non-
elevated users have rights to set the script execution policy for the CurrentUser user
scope that affects their own execution policies.
